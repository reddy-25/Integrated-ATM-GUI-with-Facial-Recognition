Additionally nn4.small2.v1.t7 is required. This is a big file. So I haven't uploaded. The same can be downloaded from "https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-data/blob/master/openface.nn4.small2.v1.t7".
  -- openface.nn4.small2.v1.t7 is copyright Carnegie Mellon University and licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.
  -- It has to be renamed as "nn4.small2.v1.t7" and has to be placed in the same directory as above folders.
  

How this works:
1. Run python software.py after installing all the required libraries it asks for.
2. Then a GUI is displayed. If you are a new user, it will ask for the details to enroll.
3. After enrolling if all the fields are valid, it will save the details in a csv file and ask for face registration. Hit space to register facial recognition.
4. This doesn't work when there is only a single user. So one user's details are already placed in the above files.
5. Once you are enrolled, you will get a message to the phone number - used fast2sms. Since sms sending is valid only for certain time, you might have to change that part of the code to a new url.
6. Now you will have access to the account and you can do certain transactions like withdraw, deposit etc. Even for these operations, it is implemented so that user gets a messages to their mobile.
